# InvestmentSolutions

## Introduction
This RPA solution was created using UiPath Studio for an assignment from Ngee Ann Polytechnic.

The assignment aims to asses my individual RPA solution development capability and implementation levels

The theme of the assignment is to use RPA to implement solutions to draw out the necessary information out of the chosen company (in my case, Meta Platforms) to propose my interests (UNSDG Goal 9).

## Techniques implemented
- Recording Tools (e.g., Basic, Web, Citrix)
- Control Features (e.g., Selectors, Web Elements, Anchor Base, Error Handling)
- Excel and Data Tables for tabulation of statistical components
- PDF Automation
- Email Automation
- Use of additional non-standard packages (BalaReva activities)
